<p class="tom">In an interview at the Democratic National Convention, Donald Trump was animate about the Dallas Cowboys and their chances of winning the big game. "I believe that the Dallas Cowboys are the greatest football team in the National Football League and I guarantee you on September 11th at 11:11 pm the Dallas Cowboys will win the NFL National Championship." His running mate George W. Bush commented on the matter as well. "I believe the New England Patriots have a lot to worry about with the absence of Tom Brady due to his ailing penis enlargement complications, may God have mercy on his soul and God Bless America." The Patriots, undefeated since the Revolutionary War, declined to comment, citing various references of American History to back up their claim that the title will go back to the Boston Tea Party Memorial Museum. Attempts to reach George Washington, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, and the Malaysian Airlines 370 Flight Crew for further comments were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>There will be a combination of the Puppy Bowl and the Super Bowl, where all wide receivers will be replaced by puppies, giving new meaning to the term "dog pile". George Bush voiced his concern, "May God have mercy on their souls and God Bless America" speaking about the puppies. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will be adopting any surviving puppies. Trump proceeds to comment, "The ASPCA is doing a fantastic job in overpopulation control of puppies, but this way is better. There will be a limited supply of furcoats available in the gift shops after the second half."</p>

<p>Silento and the Muppets will be featured in the halftime show. Kermit the Flog will whip Ms. Piggy while Mr. Ed is Nae Naying. Many big time corporations including Kraft Mayo, German Dungeon Porn Inc., and Staples have already submitted bids to sponser the show. Being this year's sponsor, ISIS will arrive in style by crashing a plane into the stadium. ISIS has given millions of dollars to Disney for the rights to Silento and the Muppets, to control them during the halftime show. For safety reasons, the NFL is having a mass evacuation of the stadium after the second quarter. Fans will be allowed to reenter at the conclusion of the show and the removal of any debree.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gordon, head of NFL operations recently stated, "Fans can buy their tickets on Craigslist. No cash, credit cards, traveler's checks, or any other form of currency will be accepted. Barter only. Do not contact seller with commercial services. Must type "BATMAN" in subject line of email so seller knows the buyer is real and not just some Joker.</p>
<p>Trump concludes the interview in saying, "This is going to be the craziest f-cking Super Bowl you've ever seen!" When asked for any final remarks, Bush simply answered with, "May God have mercy on their souls, and God Bless America!"</p>
