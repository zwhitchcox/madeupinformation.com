<p>In the final episode of wildly popular children's show, Barney, the star of the show was nowhere to be found. Charley Sheen had gone on an extreme binge of coke, mdma, tiger blood, and a plethora of other drugs. Top executives at PBS thought Sheen had really changed after spending a vation, excuse me, going to rehab in Hawaii. Much to their surprise, Sheen was not worthy of wearing the big purple dinosaur.</p>
<span style="clear:both"></span>
<p>You may be thinking Charley Sheen is a crazy son of a bitch, and you'd be right. He had some wicked ideas of how to "improve" the show. He went so far as to sneak a flame thrower into his costume and breathe fire. This went over very poorly, what with all the children's screams and "minor" injuries. Because of the contract his agent had drafted with the studio, Sheen could essentially do whatever the hell he wanted. But, murder was not one.</p>
<p>Getting back to the headline. All cast and crew had arrived on schedule, but Sheen was nowhere to be found. Because this was a children's show and Barney could easily be replaced, producer Michael Bay went to neighboring set and got Mr Rogers to fill in for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Rogers came to the set and gladly suited up, and the Earth day episode went on without a hitch. What nobody knew was that there were huge quantities of Bath Salts and LSD within the fabric of Sheen's Barney outfit. Rogers had been breathing and ingesting dangerous amounts of illegal narcotics. He began to feel the effects immediately after taping. A method actor, still being in costume, he believed he was an actual dinosaur. He began having flashbacks to his military career as a sniper.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the children attempted to hug Barney at the end of the show, their worst nightmare came to life, as Barney in full dinosaur mode began to rip the children limb from limb. In a beautiful crescendo of violence and gore, Barney's children had gone extinct. Luckily the cameras were still rolling, and Bay was able to edit  the footage to more appropriately portray what inexplicable horror these beautiful children experienced in the final moments of their short lives. Regardless to say, there were lots of explosions in the final cut. The once lovable purple dinosaur is only a faint memory as the suit is stained dark red. Rogers faces 2 terms of life in prison, and the real irony is PBS will be the only broadcasted station on all Prison televisions.</p>
