<h1>The History of Pizza</h1>
<p>Pizza was invented in the 13th century A.D. by the Mongols. Pizza was banned in 1920, because people were using it to smuggle alcohol across state lines. Later legislation was repealled, because they wanted more pizza. And what goes better than pizza than beer? That is how the Pizza-Beer combination was born.</p>

<p>Pizza also yielded another favorite food, spaghetti, when someone made a pizza, but didn't make the cheese or the bread.</p>
